# Ted-Talk-DataAnalysis
# What is the tutorial about?
The pandas library is a powerful tool for multiple phases of the data science workflow, including data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis. However, the size and complexity of the pandas library makes it challenging to discover the best way to accomplish any given task.

In this tutorial, you'll use pandas to answer questions about a real-world dataset. Through each exercise, you'll learn important data science skills as well as "best practices" for using pandas. By the end of the tutorial, you'll be more fluent at using pandas to correctly and efficiently answer your own data science questions.
# What dataset are we using?
ted.csv is the [TED Talks](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks) dataset from Kaggle Datasets, made available under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

# What do I need to do before the tutorial?
Make sure that pandas and matplotlib are installed on your computer. (The easiest way to install pandas and matplotlib is by downloading the Anaconda distribution.)
Download the CSV file from this repository.
Read the file into pandas using the read_csv() function to make sure everything is working.

# How do I download the CSV file from GitHub?
